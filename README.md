# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:**
**Overlap:**

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. -->

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

     Milestone 3. -->

**Chunk 1** — source: ``guide_accessibility.md#0 — produced by: chunker.py::split_documents``

```
Getting around the region with limited mobility

An honest assessment rather than a promotional one. Some of these places are
difficult and it is better to know in advance.
```

**Chunk 2** — source: ``guide_corry_vale.md#4 — produced by: chunker.py::split_documents``

```
Corry Vale — What to see

The valley itself is the attraction. The footpath network is dense and well marked, and a circuit taking in three of the four villages is about nine miles with 500 metres of ascent. The chapel in the second village is 12th century and always unlocked.
```

**Chunk 3** — source: ``guide_givens_mill.md#4 — produced by: chunker.py::split_documents``

```
Givens Mill — What to see

The mill runs tours on the hour from 11 to 3 and the machinery is operating during them, which is loud and much more impressive than a static exhibit. The church has a Saxon doorway. The river walk downstream reaches Brightwater in about three hours.
```

**Chunk 4** — source: ``guide_marchwood.md#3 — produced by: chunker.py::split_documents``

```
Marchwood — Eat and drink

The best eating is in the Northgate district, a 12-minute tram ride from the station, where about thirty restaurants sit within four streets. The area immediately around the station is uniformly poor and expensive. Marchwood keeps later hours than anywhere else in the region — kitchens serve until 10:30pm, and until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays.
```

**Chunk 5** — source: ``guide_seasons.md#2 — produced by: chunker.py::split_documents``

```
When to visit the region — Summer, June to August

June is excellent everywhere. July and August split: Halden Bay becomes very
busy and the parking problem dominates, Kestrelford fills with walkers, and
Brightwater goes quiet to the point of dullness with the university empty.
```

## Sample Answer

**Question:When should I go to Bridgewater?**

**Answer:**

```
  (best distance 0.457, cutoff 0.6)

May and June are the best months to visit Brightwater, with late May being arguably the best week of the year because of long days, everything running, and the students being gone. Winter is cold, and several riverside businesses close entirely from January to March, while July and August are quiet to the point of being dull.

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
